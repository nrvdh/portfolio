            <p>Climate change is an actual and much-discussed topic. 
              Personally I had never delved into this. <br><br>During this project
              I wanted to make myself more aware of the causes and consequences
              of climate change and encourage young adults to think about
              it theirselves. The point I want to make with my project is that 
             climate change is not a HOAX. By transferring this point 
             to the target group, they can be encouraged to think about 
             climate change and to discuss this subject with each other. 
             They may have a different opinion or agree with my point. <br><br>
             The information I provide to convey my point consists of
              a self-produced track about climate change, in which a conversation
             takes place between different people who have a certain opinion on this subject.</p>

              <a> WHAT </a> <br>    
              It always seemed interesting to me to be able to make my own music.
             I already had some experience playing the piano, but I had never gotten further than that.
             During this project I wanted to challenge myself to create something with a totally new medium. 
            My goal was to make a self-produced track consisting of self-recorded sounds,
             self-made melodies and samples of existing statements.
             The track reflects the sound of climate change. Not just physical sounds such as
              cutting down wood, fire and plastic, but also the sound of people using their voice
             to share their opinion.
             The track is meant to make you think about the subject climate change, and create your
              own opinion about this.
             <br> <br>
             <a> HOW </a> <br> My process consisted of researching the causes and consequences of climate change,
            researching different types of sounds and producing my own track in the software
           "Fruity Loops".
            I have linked sounds to the causes and consequences such as fire, cutting down wood, protest sounds
            etcetera.
              I went outside to seek for the sounds, I attended a protest from Greenpeace
             against plastic, I tried to make sounds myself and I collected quotes
              about climate change.
              After collecting all the different kind of sounds I started to make a melody through the piano and
             adding and distorting the recorded sounds.<br>
