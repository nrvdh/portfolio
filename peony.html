        <span><h4><div class="streep1">-</div>  <br>CONCEPT</h4>
            <p>During this minor, I focussed on several trends and problems. My
                    main topics we’re screentime and self-improvement. Nowadays we
                    are living a busy life. We have a lot on our minds such as social activities, work-related stuff, mental health, expectations, and our own
                    thoughts. All these things are connected to the use of screentime. For
                    work, we use our laptops for hours, when we want to connect we grab
                    our phones and when we are seeking for some people we put on the
                    television. We are constantly removing ourselves from the real world.
                    We don’t look around, our comfort zone is getting smaller and we are
                    losing balance. Too much screentime can cause negative feelings like
                    feeling useless and out of focus.
                    My main goal was to break our border with the real world to create
                    a more balanced life</p>

                    <br><br>
                    During my minor I created a smart plant called PEONY.<br> PEONY
                    consists out of artificial peonies. They look like real flowers but they
                    aren’t. The plant will grow based on data. This data can get collected
                    by completing PEONY missions.<br><br> When you buy PEONY you will receive the plant 
                    and a card box with missions. These missions will help
                    you balancing your life. The goal is to finish one mission a day. The
                    missions are related to topics like social communication, mindfullness
                    and stepping out of your comfort zone. These missions will lead you
                    away from your phone and show you more of the real world around
                    you. You can choose a big mission or a small mission; based on your
                    available time. You've finished a mission when you think
                    it was valuable for you. When you think it’s finished you can 
                    validate the mission in the PEONY pot. You can put the card in the slit. 
                    The pot will scan the card and when its done the peonies will grow.
                    The plant reflects your own growth. After a while, the plant will be full
                    grown. This means you will have a bush full of peonies. <br><br>A bush full
                    of peonies means a lucky and happy life. You can keep the plant like
                    this, as a symbol/achievement for yourself. Aslo, you can give the plant
                    to someone you want to experience a happy and lucky life. We
                    are used to giving flowers or plants as a gift but with PEONY we can
                    make this even more valuable.  </p>
